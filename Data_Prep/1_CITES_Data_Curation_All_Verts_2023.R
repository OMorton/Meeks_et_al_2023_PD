##---CITES raw data curation---##
#################################

## Author - O Morton 
## Date - 09/02/23
## Notes - Processing methods derived from Harfoot et al (2018) and code from Morton et al (2022, 2023 in press) and Jackson et al (2023 in prep)

## Purpose
## 1. To read in the raw cites data product.
## 2. Process it to WOES.
## 3. For captive and wild trade, in pet and products with exporter and importer links included.
## 4. Timeframe 2000 - 2020
## Runtime ~ 5 minutes


#### Packages and presets ####

## global options settings
options(scipen = 999) ## remove scientific notation, namely "e"  to show very small and large numbers in full.
options(na.action = "na.pass")
## Set working directory and package location.
## These need changing to your file paths.
# setwd("G:/My Drive/TUoS/Teaching/Masters/2022/Dom_Meeks/Project")
#.libPaths("C:/Packages") ## Set up for working from home.

## for all plotting and data handling
library(tidyverse)


#### Functions ####


## function to create t/f vector, function courtesy of Simon 
unroll <- function(col) {
  ind <- !is.na(col)
  headers <- col[ind]
  headers[cumsum(ind)]
}

# function to get count in year prior (checks that year interval ==1)
count_prior <- function(count, diff_priorYr, interval=1) {
  out <- rep(NA, length(count))
  # out vector with an observation in year prior (when interval == 1) gets the 
  # count from the year prior. When there is no observation in the year prior, 
  # it returns NA
  out[which(diff_priorYr==interval)] <- count[(which(diff_priorYr==interval)-interval)]
  out
}

#### Bulk data download and tidying ####

## Read in the 46 seperate .csv's from CITES latest Bulk release 2021 v1.
## https://trade.cites.org/ database is availble here needs downloading and saving.
## Then you supply the code below with the path to the entire file of csv's not to an individual one, the function then reads in all 46 csvs and 
## appends them.
## Takes a few minutes to run ~ results in a database with 25021290 records.
CITES_MASTER <- list.files(path="C:/Users/OMorton/OneDrive - University of Cambridge/Data/CITES/CITES_all_records_2023.1",
                           full.names = TRUE, pattern="*.csv") %>% 
  lapply(read_csv, na = "", col_types = cols(Unit = col_character(), Import.permit.RandomID = col_character(),
                                    Export.permit.RandomID = col_character(), Origin.permit.RandomID = col_character(),
                                    Purpose = col_character())) %>% 
  bind_rows


## Remove all re-exports as per published CITES guidelines and Pers Comm with UNEP-WMC and CITES
## remove all reports where the origin is stated and is not the same as the exporter.
## This avoids double counting i.e. where a trade passes through multiple countries. 
CITES_TRUE <- CITES_MASTER %>% filter(Origin == Exporter  | is.na(Origin)) # this leaves 13.4 out 23.6 million shipments

## Focus on only the target taxa, you may want to broaden this to other taxa.
## this leaves 3.8 million records
CITES_TRUE <- CITES_TRUE %>% filter(Class %in% c("Aves", "Mammalia", "Amphibia", "Reptilia"))


#### Subset into wild source and commercial purpose ####

## Define captive and wild sourced trade and remove all ambiguous records see guide here for source code explanations
## Commercial purpose as defined by ourselves. We justify the inclusion of personal under commercial to capture aspects of the pet trade,
## as done in previous studies see Bush et al (2014). See guide here for purpose code explanations.
## https://trade.cites.org/cites_trade_guidelines/en-CITES_Trade_Database_Guide.pdf
## Now 2.0 million records
CITES_Vert <- CITES_TRUE %>% mutate(Source_clean = case_when(Source %in% c("W", "X", "R") ~ "Wild",

                                               Source %in% c(NA, "I", "U", "O") ~ "Ambiguous"),

  filter(Source_clean %in% c("Wild", "Captive"), Purpose_clean == "Commercial") 





#### Convert to WOE's ####

## import the conversion table used by Harfoot et al. A WOE is a whole organism equivalent and standardises all the terms CITES uses.
## Change file path to yours.
WOE_Factors <- data.table::fread("C:/Users/OMorton/OneDrive - University of Cambridge/Data/CITES/Conversion/Harfoot_Clean.csv")
WOE_Factors_all <- WOE_Factors %>% filter(Species_specific == 0) %>% select(Class, Term, Factor)
WOE_Factors_sp <- WOE_Factors %>% filter(Species_specific == 1) %>% select(Class, Term, Taxa_applicable, Factor)

## Match the trade terms with the WOE conversion terms and add the factor for conversion.
CITES_Vert <- left_join(CITES_Vert, WOE_Factors_all, by = c("Class", "Term")) %>% 
  left_join(WOE_Factors_sp, by = c("Class", "Term", "Taxon" = "Taxa_applicable")) %>%
  mutate(Factor = ifelse(is.na(Factor.y), Factor.x, Factor.y)) %>%
  select(-Factor.x, -Factor.y)

## Calculate WOEs - you take the quantity traded multiplied by conversion term.
CITES_Vert <- CITES_Vert %>% mutate(WOE = Factor*Quantity)

## Note only consider records where the unit is NA.This is important nuance as well as terms CITES trade is in various forms of unit
## including grams, boxes etc - these are ambiguous and cant be converted.
## Only the NA unit records can be - na is used when the term is the unit so 1 tusk = 1 tusk rather than 1 kg of tusk
left_join(
  CITES_Vert %>% filter(is.na(Unit)|Unit == "Number of specimens", !is.na(WOE)) %>%group_by(Class) %>% summarise(Converted = n()), 
  CITES_Vert %>% group_by(Class) %>% tally()) %>% 
  mutate(Prop = Converted/n)

## only keep the NA unit and the woes with a value
## This reduces the data to 1.5 million
CITES_Vert <- CITES_Vert %>% filter(is.na(Unit)|Unit == "Number of specimens", !is.na(WOE))

## In total 304,328,043 vert WOEs moved since the stard of CITES (Commericial, Captive and wild trade and purposes)
sum(na.omit(CITES_Vert$WOE))

## Figure shows the values for 2021 and 2022 are clearly incomplete.
## it is uncertain how many reports are still pending for 2018 or earlier.
CITES_Vertplot <- CITES_Vert %>% filter(Year %in% c(2000:2022)) %>% group_by(Year) %>% tally()
CITES_Vert %>% group_by(Year) %>% tally() %>%

## Trim the data to our time frame - change if different time frame is needed. (1.48 million)
CITES_Vert <- CITES_Vert %>% filter(Year %in% c(1999:2021))

#### Importer or Exporter #####
## CITES trade can be reported by both the importing and exporting country. So the data set essentially "should" count most things twice.
## These never match up though and for a number of reasons cant really be expected to.
## Best practice is to focus on one reporting source - ultimately we will analyse both but separately.
CITES_Vert %>% group_by(Reporter.type) %>% tally()
#CITES_Vert <- CITES_Vert %>% filter(Reporter.type == "E")

#### Original listing ####

## extract species in trade taxonomic information
## 1864 species in both Imp and Exp reported data sets
(CITES_Species <- CITES_Vert %>% filter(Year %in% c(2000:2021), !grepl("spp", Taxon), !grepl("hybrid", Taxon),
                                        !Appendix == "N", WOE >0) %>%
                                      group_by(Taxon) %>% slice(1) %>% select(Class, Order, Family, Genus, Taxon) %>% ungroup()) 

## 1.29 million
CITES_Vert <- CITES_Vert %>% filter(Year %in% c(2000:2021), !grepl("spp", Taxon), !grepl("hybrid", Taxon),
                                    !Appendix == "N", WOE >0) 

## This may or may not be relevant to you - I needed this to make individual species time series e.g. if a species was traded yearly 2000 - 2010
## but not after 2010 I needed to add these years and fill the volumes with 0 (not traded - cites doesnt do this its only a record of trade that 
## happened). But the issue is what if the species was only cites listed 2000 - 2012, as cites only records trade in listed species so after 2012 
## trade wouldnt be reported to cites so those years shouldnt have zeros there should be no values.
## Thus this code uses the cites listings database to extract the time periods the species were listed for and add the actual trade and 0's to
## that.

## Read in the cites historic listings data
Historic_CITES <- data.table::fread("Data/History_of_CITES_Listings_2021.csv") %>%

#### Remove CITES Deletion ####

## extract the true cites deletions
## We considered removing these, but that would bias the data against "success stories". Therefore we

## Add the deletions to the trade database as a separate year of deletion collumn.
## Later we will use this as an end point for all these series.
## All other species that had not been deleted will have full time series to 2018, therefore we can add the
## final year (2018) to the species without a deletion year.
